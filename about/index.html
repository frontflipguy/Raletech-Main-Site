<div class="title">About Me</div> 
<div class="text">My name is Bradley Raley. In 2012 I completed my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Central 
Florida. Since then, my academic and professional interests have shifted to software development and web design. Working on raletech.com 
is one of my favorite hobbies and it helps me better myself as a coder, so it's a win-win!</div>

<div class="title">About the Puzzles</div>
<div class="text">These puzzles are presented without any rules or clues for solving them, so it's up to you to figure them out. My advice for finding the solution is that you
	use trial and error and think outside of the box. Also, I realize that it can be really frustrating 
	if you're just not on the same wavelength as I was when I thought up the puzzles. I totally understand that and there's no shame in that. There is a hint button
	in the top right corner of every puzzle to help you out.

<div class="title">About the 2-player Games</div>
<div class="text">
	These games are for 1-on-1 competition. You and a friend (or yourself, if you have no friends like me) can play these games together. The rules governing these games are simple and can be understood
	quickly, but the best strategies for winning may take more time to figure out. I hope that you find these games interesting and worth playing.
