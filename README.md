# Raletech-Main-Site
All the code written for the puzzles, games, and other functionalities on raletech.com

The file structure here mirrors the structure of the website so you might have to drill down to get to index.html, where most of the meat of the code is. (At this point all js is in HTML pages for ease of simultaneously developing the HTML and the js.)

As of January 2017 all code is in HTML, CSS, Javascript and even some PHP.

Finally, if you are someone I'm collaborating with or a potential employer checking out my github to see if I actually know how to code, thank you for visiting!
