			previously saved mad lib you can enter it here to retrieve the clues for that mad lib, fill them out, then see the completed mad lib.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="col1"><input type="button" value = "Reset"></td><td class="col2">This performs a Hard Refresh of the page. I.e. It resets all fields back to their initial values.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="col1">Write your mad lib:</td><td class="col2">The text area below this statement is where you can write your own mad lib. It comes pre-filled with an example; 
			notice that the words that are to be replaced are in [brackets] and they describe a type of word. You MUST USE [brackets] 
			to denote replaceable words or else your mad lib will not work.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="col1"><input type="button" value="Save as..."></td><td class="col2">Once you've written a mad lib, you can save it. 
			You cannot use a name that someone else has already used, so try to choose a unique name.
			Once you've saved it, anyone can access it using the <input type="button" value = "Enter Code"> button if they have the name. (Bear in mind that 
			what you write is not necessarily private and could possibly be accessed by people other than your intended audience, 
			so please don't write anything too profane, disturbing, or creepy. If you do and I happen to see it, I will probably delete it.)</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="col1"><input type="button" value="Done!"></td><td class="col2">Once you've written your mad lib, if you are ready to play it, 
			click this button to go to the filling-out-the-words part.</td></tr>
		<tr><td class="col1">Fill in your words:</td><td class="col2">This appears at the top of the filling-out-the-words window. There are fields for you to 
			-you guessed it- fill out the words!</td></tr>
		<tr><td class=""><input type="button" value="Ready!"></td><td class="col2">This button is at the bottom of the filling-out-the-words window. 
			Click it once you've filled in the words to see what your mad lib says!</td></tr>
