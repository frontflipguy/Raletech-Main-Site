		<div>Dear Hiring Manager:</div>
			<br>
			<div id="first">My name is Bradley Raley and I am applying for <div class="idiv" id="aoran">a</div> <input value="job title" class="input-box1" disabled> position at <input value="company" class="input-box2" id="companyBox" disabled> in <input value="location" class="input-box" id="locBox" disabled>. After researching the goals and expectations of <input value="company" class="input-box2" id="companyBox" disabled> employees, I admire the demand for quality of character and the value placed on individual excellence to benefit the vision <input value="expanding technological horizons" class="input-box-long" id="buzz1Box" disabled>. I want to work at <input value="company" class="input-box2" id="companyBox" disabled> so that I can contribute my skills to a company that <input value="really makes a difference in the customer service industry" class="input-box-long2" id="buzz2Box" disabled>.</div>
			<br>
		<div id="second">In my current work as a Production Coordinator, I value clear communication when collaborating with coworkers and assisting clients. I also strive to achieve precision, accuracy, and attention to detail in everything I put my name on. For example, when a client makes a request to change some of our web content, but does not specify how they want it changed, I write to the client and begin a conversation about how we can best satisfy their needs. I would maintain this mindset in a position at <input value="company" class="input-box2" id="companyBox" disabled> not only because it contributes to customer satisfaction and excellent products, but also because I take pride in the quality of my work.</div>
			<br>
		<div>Alongside my career pursuits, I enjoy developing various self-taught skills and creative projects of my own. I code games and puzzles in JavaScript, draw, write, and train my body. I like learning new techniques and honing my skills to better myself as an artist. My ability to self-teach allows me to adapt quickly to new processes and concepts in both my hobbies and the workplace.</div>
			<br>
		<div id="fourth">I look forward to using my skills to contribute to the positive community at <input value="company" class="input-box2" id="companyBox" disabled>. Thank you for your consideration of my application. I hope to meet with you in person regarding the <input value="job title" class="input-box1" disabled> position soon. If you have any questions before then please feel free contact me at the above address.</div>
			<br>
		Sincerely,<br>
		Bradley Raley
